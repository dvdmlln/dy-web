      - text: ...grade diese Mischung macht "HOW ARE YOU?" zu einem wahnsinnig spannenden Album, zu dem man gleichermaßen abschalten und aufdrehen kann, in dem man sich vergessen und in dem man nachdenken kann, in dem man sich verliert und findet.

            how are you
            darling don’t tell me the truth
            how are you, now
            where’re you from, where will you go?
            show me all the things I know
            how are you, oh
            I'm just another waste of time, tell me all your favorite lies
            how are you, now

            that you are falling
            down on earth again
            chemicals will help you
            to erase your memories
            lay your head on my chest
            you'll be fine
            I am your shelter for tonight
            just for tonight
            so tomorrow you're gone
            I’m alone again
            I don't know where you're from
            I don't remember your name

            how are you
            darling don’t tell me the truth
            how are you, now
            where’re you from, where will you go?
            show me all the things I know
            how are you, oh

            and every time I saw you
            you had changed your name
            when we sway we feel alive

            how are you

        lyrics: |
            I cling to you
            'cause we feel the same
            we're drunk and bored
            we don’t belong here
            come with me, there's a loophole to escape
            suburbanites have always scared us, so we have to leave

            yeah the city is screaming our names
            take my hand and run away with me
            everything we ever wanted is finally within reach
            I can't wait to see it

            the force of habit hits you there
            no matter how far you run from the past
            it always catches up and bites you hard

            I miss the green fields and the smell of the woods
            I miss my childhood
            I am homesick
            will I ever return?

            where we see the stars
            and fear does not exist
            we are home
            where I can see us dancing
            and you're screaming my name
            come and say my name

            so tell me where do we belong now?

            do you want to give up?
            even if it kills us
            there's no turning back

            I betray myself
            when the streets are shining
            please take my hand
            we're trapped in traffic lights
            what have we done?
            we have lost our roots
            we betray ourselves
            never wanted to wear those shoes

        lyrics: |
            throw me back to 1991, I promise you I won´t change a thing
            the problem isn’t me, it´s just the place we need to stay
            so follow me, she said one day
            follow me, escape, escape

            think of all the joy you find
            when you leave the world behind
            I never wanted to grow up, but everything has changed
            I want you to show me, how I can escape
            fuck, take me away from everything

            so think of the happiest things, it´s the same as having wings
            on my run from all who banished me
            so think of the happiest things, it´s the same as having wings
            let me forget the mess I’ve left

            but there is something I remember
            her whisper in my head
            “who are you?” and “please come back again”
            when I try to repeat her words, when I try to find my wings
            and I guess this time I’m not sleeping because I got this feeling more intense than last night

            so think of the happiest things, it´s the same as having wings
            on my run from all who banished me

            all I need is somewhere far away
            second star to the right, where we escape

            oh kid don’t be stupid
            don´t mess up your fucking life
            there’s hope behind blurred walls
            you can´t see with sleepy eyes
            oh kid don´t give up now
            there´s a world in front of you
            keep your head up and your mind set
            so much I need to show you

            oh boy don´t play with fire
            it might be

            the warmth you need
            take care of yourself tonight
            it´s easier if you can hide
            the warmth you need
            replace the fucking cold inside
            shut your eyes and give up the fight

            this is just a rainy day
            nothing has changed
            I close the door and medicate myself
            this is just a rainy day
            nothing has changed
            why does it always rain on me

            I cannot sleep, or even dream
            so what is in front of me
            I´m selfish I know and always alone
            too blind to see the demons I feed
            I hide in self-destruction, my life is so destructive
            I find comfort in self-pity, it´s too late I´ll never change

            what should I be surprised about
            I’ve seen it all
            this is just a rainy day
            always the same routine

            this is just a rainy day
            nothing has changed
            I close the door and medicate myself
            this is just a rainy day
            nothing has changed
            why does it always rain on me

            and I know it’s harmful
            to follow my demons
            and I won’t overcome
            my habits right now
            and this is just a rainy day
            nothing has, nothing has
            ever changed

            and I know it was my fault

            when we were so young
            much too young

            it hurts like fire

            still fighting with my ghost

            there´s a stranger in the mirror
            hello sinner, how are you?
            what do you feel when they judge you?

            why do you despise me?
            why do you? you never ask me how I am
            and it seems like you don´t want to understand
            the truth
            it´s easier to stigmatize, you turned a blind eye to me

            so why do you call me a sinner?
            without a reason you're judging me
            even though you never felt the same

            you feed my pain
            no, if you don´t care, don´t speak to me
            if you won´t help, you can not see
            let me go
            I know it´s time to lose it all
            when the spoon in my hand almost glows

            so I try
            to leave it all behind
            all my fears, all my life
            my hands are shaking because they know it is time to lose it all
            I´m a sinner, I´m a thief
            all that you want me to be

            there´s no difference

        lyrics: |
            we’ve seen it all
            sitting in our sheltered homes
            we are so aware
            but do we even care?

            I’m seized with remorse
            all day long
            trying to comprehend
            what might have gone wrong
            'it’s not our business, it’s not our fault'
            challenge your point of view
            that’s all I’m asking for

            what have we become?
            thinking of nothing but ourselves
            is it our nature? is it in our veins?
            instead of lending a hand
            we only look away

            selflessness is a rare virtue these days

            think about everyday’s misery
            all these people suffering
            oh can’t you hear them scream?
            it’s not that far away, you know
            just take a walk right down the street

            I would give everything just to see them smile one single time

            we’ve seen it all
            we are aware
            but do we even care?

            and when I read the papers or turn on the TV
            I find it hard to realize what I see
            all these senseless deaths
            caused by senseless reasons
            hadn’t we enough of it?
            will it ever end? my heart is bleeding

            and I just can’t get this image out of my head
            a little child in pain lying in a hospital bed
            heartbeats getting faster in fear

            amplitudes on a screen
            about to disappear

            we have to free ourselves from this sickness

            I’m seized with remorse
            all day long
            trying to comprehend
            trying to figure out
            what I could do

            and I wonder what has happened to you
            what troubles in life you’ve been through
            how little joy and how much pain

            how did you get to this point?

            pouring out your heart to strangers
            talking about what you’ve lost in life
            talking about how you feel tonight
            and that you know what would
            be the right thing to do

            but this sickness it holds you
            with cold fingers around your neck
            your eyes begging please, oh please
            don’t turn your back on me
            like everyone else did

            please don’t turn your back

            I can’t do this fight alone
            I can’t find a way out

            turning to the bottle again
            day after day
            night after night
            keep asking yourself
            is it worth the fight?

            until you are save again
            with a future and a dream to chase

            we’re searching our luck elsewhere
            there’s nothing left for us here

            we had to leave fast
            all things were packed
            no chance for goodbyes
            will I ever come back?

            we’re searching for luck elsewhere
            there’s nothing left for us here'

            through the deepest seas
            across the highest mountains they flee
            driven by hope and awful memories

            can we even imagine how this must feel like?
            leaving home with no chance for goodbyes

        lyrics: |
            more and more we forget what’s worth living for
            and what matters most

            always trying not to fail
            but losing our path anyway
            we’re hiding our inner selfs
            behind masks and thick walls

            we won’t dare to speak forbidden words
            because the truth, it hurts
            just too much

            we close our eyes to it
            and turn away
            rather keep on lying
            than displease anyone
            while trying to fit in
            we betray ourselves

            we play our sick, pathetic roles
            in this everyday play
            day after day

            drowning in our own sad stories
            our mistakes, our fears, our worries

            and when we look up to the stars
            we realize just how small we are

            oh how we take it all for granted
            and forget just how precious life is
            playing our roles day after day
            don’t let this gift waste away

            don’t let it waste away

            and when we look up to the stars
            we realize just how small we are

            dare to take a further step
            don’t give up, make the best of your choices
            dare to let your flaws behind
            make up your mind
            this is your life

            oh how we take it all for granted
            and forget just how precious life is

        lyrics: |
            I’m not special, I’m not much
            I’ve learned from people I met
            from those who’ve touched my heart, my soul
            those who changed my view
            and let my mind grow
            who inspired me to believe in myself
            to become who I am now

            retracing the process
            I finally see
            I’ve always been from messed up to crisis
            I never wanted to hurt anyone on my way
            but I guess I did
            I guess we all do, all the same mistakes
            unfortunately, this is how it always was
            how it will always be
            I feel like my time’s running out
            I’m getting older but am I getting wiser as well?

            only time will tell
            maybe I just want to leave my mark in this world
            before I disappear again
            a body turned cold, unimportant
            untold stories of a lifetime
            secrets I keep
            forever hidden in my mind, buried deep
            too afraid, to let anyone find them

            no, release me from this dark night
            clear my sight, hope, bring me home

            please my friends, believe me
            I’m not always like this
            bitter and frustrated
            cause it all seems pointless
            or maybe I am just too ambitious, too focused?

            I never meant to cause a mess
            repeating the same old excuses
            again and again
            but the truth is
            I’m the only one to blame

            I never wanted to disappoint those I care about
            those who still love me all the same, without any doubt

            is it all in my head
            is there a way out?

            matching my state of mind

            did I make peace with my mistakes?
            the doubt still remains
            persistently, only slowly fading away

            and then I saw her
            her eyes filled with tears
            her face a reflection
            of my own fears

            'I’m sorry, can I help you?

            that would make all of my demons just go away?

            I want it all to disappear
            so say, can you take me away from here?
            to leave behind all what I’ve done
            and what was done to me
            so say, do you really think that you could fix this?'

            matching our state of mind

            I’d give it all away
            it’s you I adore
            you brought the light back into my life

            and when you smile
            the whole world seems to smile with you
            and when you laugh
            my heart skips a beat

            but on that day it was ripped apart
            I swear it was just a glimpse, just a second
            you were gone suddenly
            who stole you from us?
            who stole you from me?

            can you hear me?
            we used to be happy
            how could you dare to erase such beauty
            I’m not quite sure if I ever truly hated
            but I truly hate you
            you’re all the world’s evil impersonated

            so listen closely
            whoever you are
            wherever you hide
            you should fear for your life
            cause I swear if I find you
            I’ll bring it to an end
            with my own bare hands

            and the joy that was mine
            eye for an eye
            I am probably losing my mind

            how could you dare to defile such innocence
            I cannot understand
            I cannot grasp one single clear thought
            oh my calls fade away into the dark
            there’s no light left
            not one single spark

            you took our child, destroyed our lives
            you stole the light, the joy that was mine

            Just take, Just take one look back

            Should this be our legacy?
            It makes me sick!

            Who has the right to survive?
            So, go on just tell me
            what's it you're longing for
            and is it all worth this?
            I can't stand it anymore

            With every further step,

            this misery we're in

            Another love lost

      - title: Chasing Dreams
        lyrics: |
            With every further passing night
            I feel like losing hope
            I feel like losing sight

            Is there any sense
            in chasing dreams?

            After every step forward
            follow two steps back

            This bitter taste just won't leave
            These fearful thoughts in my head

            Oh my dear sun, I am afraid
            it's getting harder every day
            to warm my heart

            Since I left home
            years ago
            with an untroubled mind
            and a goal unknown

            It felt like the whole world's in front of me
            So many things to do, so many things to see

            But what did I achieve?

            Or could it be I'm nothing more but a fraud
            with his lies falling apart

            These questions stay with me
            permanently

            And I wish I could rest
            just for a while
            But then, from time to time
            there appears a smile,
            a pretty one
            But unlike the doubts
            she won't stay for long

            What have I done?

            Where did I go wrong?

            You are actually aware,
            so pick up yourself
            You can do better than this
            your heart screams for it

            So, realizing what I want to be
            was a painful process, indeed
            And I hope that I've learned my lesson from it
            I'm pretty sure I'm not alone feeling like this

            So I just keep on waiting for better times,
            whenever they might come

            So I just keep on waiting for better times,
            for me
            for you
            for everyone
